# RBLXGrassModule
A simple Grass Module that is customizable &amp; more optimization friendly by having a set amount and generating grass wherever the player is going

!!CAUTION!!  
This module is better for optimization but has it's limits and can cause severe frame drops if not handled properly or if the device is too weak
